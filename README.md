![Luftmensch icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lheredias/Luftmensch/main/finalicon.ico)

```
Version 1.0 released in January 2021.
```
## Description

Creates a Graphical User Interface capable of:
    
* Merging PDF files
* Convert PDF into PDF/A
* Have all the pages of a PDF file adopt vertical A4 dimensions without messing up its content.

Although can be used altogether, each option is independent from one another.

Its flexibility and capability of dealing with many scenarios means exceedingly simple usage instructions for end user.

Althought target users are personnel from the ***Tax and Customs Office of Peru*** (hence the definitions in Spanish), the entirety or just portions of the present code can be applied to a wide range of contexts, in both work and academic environments.

As of January 2021, Luftmensch is in active development.

## Platforms

Currently supports Windows only but can be easily adapted to Mac OS (*this is a work in progress*).
